# Pittsburgh Neighborhoods

Open the website by running `python server.py` and opening
`http://localhost:5000/static/` in your browser.

## TODO
- [ ] Deselect neighborhoods on mouseout and update the detail panel
    - this was intentional, b/c otherwise the neighborhood deselected when hovering circles. idk if we can make it disappear only if the mose leaves the mouse, but tbh seems like too much work for a minor issue
- [X] Add some useful information to the detail panel
- [X] Animate filtering behavior
eh kinda did this
- [X] Build out the detail view for houses
- [X] Reposition the neighborhood box
- [X] Add some more filters (which ones?)
  - checkboxes for home type, input range for beds and baths
- [X] Make numbers on the filter bar nicer
- [X] Style the filter pane
- [X] Style the detail pane
- [ ] Update neighborhood label when moving between neighborhoods (without 
      zooming fully out)
- [ ] I have a stretch goal idea for a really cool interaction where points are distinguished as you hover over filters
